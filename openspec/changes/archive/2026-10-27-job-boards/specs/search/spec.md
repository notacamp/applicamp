## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Search reads approved job boards and credits them
A search SHALL read only job boards the owner approved, honour each board's
terms (polling limits, attribution, unchanged apply links, expiry), merge the
same job seen on several boards into one opportunity, and show every source
with a link to the original posting.

#### Scenario: The same job on two boards
- **WHEN** a job with the same apply link is found on Himalayas and RemoteOK
- **THEN** one opportunity is added, showing both boards as sources with links

#### Scenario: A board's polling limit
- **WHEN** a search runs twice within Remotive's allowed interval
- **THEN** Remotive is not fetched the second time and its cached jobs are used
